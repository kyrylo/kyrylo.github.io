During lunch today, I watched a review of Syphon Filter: a PS1 game that left
such a mark on my childhood that I used to design levels for it on paper when I
was six.

It made me think: do kids today get to experience something like that? A game
that exists in one form, fully, forever?

Probably not. Because when I say Syphon Filter, if you’ve played it too, we’re
talking about the same thing. A shared memory. But in today’s world of SaaS and
endless updates, there’s no such thing as a final version anymore.

Progress doesn’t always mean better. We've become loyal followers of the Church
of Recurring Revenue, and somewhere along the way, we lost the magic of limits.
I get it, business software has to evolve to keep up with the world. But deep
down, I believe some software would be better, more secure, and more
_delightful_ if it simply… stopped evolving. If it reached its final form.

Take Minecraft. Which Minecraft? The one before the Nether? After Redstone? With
or without Story Mode? The name is the same, but the experiences are fragmented.
There’s no single snapshot we all share.

With [Telebugs](https://telebugs.com), I want to bring that magic back. I want
to build something that, like a butterfly, grows to completion - and then stays
that way. Something people can point to and say: yes, that’s the one.
