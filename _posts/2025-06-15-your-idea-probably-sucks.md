If you think you have a brilliant idea, I have bad news: your idea probably _sucks_.

I get "brilliant" ideas almost every day.

They feel like intrusive thoughts. I call them **derails**, because I can’t afford
to jump into a new big project.

Derails usually hit me in the shower or right before sleep.

I jot them down and back-burn them. If I keep obsessing over the same idea for a
few days, then maybe, _maybe_, it’s worth spending an hour planning.

That’s when I describe it to an LLM. I ask it to poke holes, find weaknesses, or
even build a small artifact. That usually satisfies the craving for a day or
two.

If the idea still haunts me, I just cope. The more ideas you get, the more cope
you need. And over time, you revisit that idea and realize... it sucks.

Why?

Because you didn’t give it time to _rot_. Initial excitement blinds you. You only
see the potential, not the flaws.

This is why your idea might not be as great as you think: you’re too close to
it. But while you're still excited, **simplify** it. Because almost certainly,
it’s way too complex.

So next time you think you’ve struck gold, sit with it. Let it cool. Let it rot
a bit. Let it _earn_ your attention.

Because a good idea survives boredom. A bad one needs excitement to stay alive.
And if it _does_ survive? Well, now you have something worth building.
